  <p class="next">You’re in the business of making people happy. <br> 

    Whether that comes as a delicious meal, the ideal hotel <br> stay, or a party like it’s 1999, good times are your M.O. <br>
    
    But if you’re not sure how to sell those good times, I’m <br> here to help.  <br>
    
    I’m Kate McDermott, and Eat, Drink, and Write Copy is <br> how I help busy hospitality pros get more website visitors <br> and increased sales in a super competitive market. <br>
    
    You bring the celebration; I bring the communication. <br>
    
    (But you should bring the cocktails.)</p>

  <p class="passing"> Were you one of those people who always knew what they wanted to be when they grew up? I’m very jealous.  <br>
    
    As a kid, I never had a very clear picture of what I wanted to do with my life. The only thing that sounded appealing was reading all day. But I didn’t want to be an editor. I just wanted to read and get paid for it…alas, that job still doesn’t exist.  <br>
    
    I grew up in a musical family, and I’ve always had a pleasant singing voice. I loved to perform, and figured I had as good a shot as making it as anyone else.  So like many other wide-eyed teens, I decided I would become a singer. <br>
    
    I enrolled in music school, but there was a problem — while I enjoyed performing, I didn’t particularly like practicing. And if you’re trying to get great at something competitive, you have to put in the hours. <br>
    
    I figured out pretty quickly that I didn’t have the heart for it. <br>
    
    While I waited for inspiration, I had to make a living. So I went to the #1 place for oddballs and outsiders, the place where everyone fits in: the restaurant industry. <br>
    
    </p>

    <p class="spassing">It didn’t take too long to realize that I wouldn’t be a service industry “lifer.” Working FOH just wasn’t my cup of tea, although I did it for about eight years at bars, restaurants, and a catering company. 

      But I do love restaurant people. <br>
      
      Eventually, I found myself working as executive assistant to a local restaurateur where I spent nearly five years on marketing, promotions, building community, and one heck of a construction project. <br> 
      
      By early 2019, I was ready for my next challenge. So I began EDWC, a place where I could combine my love for the wonderful weirdos in hospitality with my word-nerd roots. <br>
      
      It took me a while to get here…but along the way I learned about the unique challenges that  hospitality pros face. And now I use that knowledge to help you spread the word and connect with customers. <br> 
      
      I’ve written for clients as close as up the street and as far as Saudi Arabia. And I’d love to work with you. <br>
